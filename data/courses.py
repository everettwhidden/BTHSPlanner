        "description": "This genre-specific class dives right into the big questions: Why are science fiction and fantasy appealing and what are their origins? How does a journey in an unreal world inform and influence our perspective of the “real” world? How does the creation of alternate realities create a safe space for authors to discuss their social, political, and cultural realities? How do science-fiction and fantasy texts build upon classical texts for inspiration and themes? We explore some of these questions in our encounters with dystopian worlds and outer-space, mythologies and modern fantasy. Text selection varies but may include works by the following authors: Margaret Atwood, Neil Gaiman, J.R.R. Tolkien, Mary Shelley, Isaac Asimov, Phillip K. Dick, Octavia Butler, Ken Liu, Rebecca Roanhoarse, Ray Bradbury, Ursula K. Le Guinn, student-selected books and many others. Emphasis is placed on literary analysis and expository writing, but the class also includes opportunities for speeches, individual and group presentations/lessons, creative writing and artwork.",
